                  We were inspired to change the way students begin studying abroad, or in our case in the US.
                  The idea came up in October 2015 and after hard work on everyone's part, we are confident in saying we have achieved our goal with MyUniversity.
                  Without further ado, the people behind the project:</p>

                  Whilst being the youngest in the team (16 years old), George was the largest influence throughout the entire project. He came up with the idea and inspired everyone.
                  He also speaks English and French on a native level. He once won a French debate competition launched in Thessaloniki in 2014. A year after he was invited to be a member of
                  the judges in the same competition.
                  During the last 5 months he came to the conclusion that "no matter how music changes, we must never stop dancing", a truly inspiring analogy of life
                  He plans to enter law school and eventually become a lawyer.
                  A true visionary.

                 Angel, 17 years old, born and living in Athens, was introduced to the project by Petros', who Angel is an online acquaintance of.
                 He is an expert in Web Development, with advanced knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Meteor.js framework,Bootstrap 3, Django an the list goes on an on.
                 He is also highly skilled in photo editing and fixed some graphical assets for use on the website.
                Angel taught Petros' everything he knows in terms of Web Development and greatly helped him when he had difficulties.
                This project would have not looked the same or rather even made possible without his assistance and mentoring.
                As for his plans for the future, he aims to study Software Engineering or Computer Science in a high-rank University in the UK.
                We, the main team, can not thank him enough and wish him well on his future endavours.

                <p class="flow-text">Meteor.js is a full-stack JavaScript Framework that makes things like database management and reactive interfaces super simple.
                  It is also responsible for the insane loading speeds of MyUniversity.
                  As for Materialize.css, it is a CSS framework that makes Material Design really accessible and easy to use.
