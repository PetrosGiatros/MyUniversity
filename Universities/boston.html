  United States, 6 miles (9.7 km) west of downtown Boston. It has 9,100 full-time undergraduates and almost 5,000 graduate students.
  The university's name reflects its early history as a liberal arts college and preparatory school (now Boston College High School) in Boston's South End.
  It is a member of the 568 Group and the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.
  Its main campus is a historic district and features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America.
  Boston College's undergraduate program is currently ranked 30th in the National Universities ranking by U.S. News & World Report.
  Boston College is categorized as a research university with high research activity by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
  Students at the university earned 21 Fulbright Awards in 2012, ranking the school eighth among American research institutions. At $2.22 billion,
  Boston College has the 39th largest university endowment in North America.Boston College sports teams are called the Eagles, and their colors are maroon and gold; the school mascot is Baldwin the Eagle.
  The Eagles compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference in all sports offered by the ACC. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in Hockey East.
  Boston College's men's ice hockey team is one of the most decorated programs in the nation, having won five national championships.
  Boston College's main campus in Chestnut Hill, 6 miles (9.7 km) west of downtown Boston, is 175-acre (710,000 m2) and includes over 120 buildings set on a hilltop overlooking the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.
  A Boston College streetcar station on metro Boston's 'T', or public transit system, is located at St. Ignatius Gate; it is the western terminus of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green
  Line's B-branch (also known as the Boston College line) and connects the school to Boston's city center and to destinations in the Boston metropolitan area. Due largely to its location and presence of
  buildings featuring gothic towers reaching into the sky, the Boston College campus is known generally as the 'Heights' and to some as the 'Crowned Hilltop'.
  The main campus is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Its annual operating budget is approximately $667 million. The most recent and ongoing fundraising campaign, dubbed
  'Light the World', was announced on October 11, 2008. The seven-year campaign aims to raise $1.5 billion in honor of the 150th anniversary of the college. Funds raised will be used to support the strategic
  priorities of the university, including academic programs, financial aid, Jesuit Catholic identity, athletics, student programming, and capital construction projects.</p>
