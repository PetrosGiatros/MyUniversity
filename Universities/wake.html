<p>Wake Forest University is a private, independent, nonprofit, non-sectarian, coeducational research university inWinston-Salem, North Carolina, founded in 1834.
The university received its name from its original location in Wake Forest, north of Raleigh, North Carolina, the state capital.
The Reynolda Campus, the university's main campus, has been located north of downtown Winston-Salem since the university moved there in 1956.
The Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center campus is located near the Ardmore neighborhood in central Winston-Salem.
The University also occupies lab space at Biotech Plaza, at the downtown Piedmont Research Park, and at the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials.
The University's Graduate School of Management maintains a presence on the main campus in Winston-Salem and in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Notable people of Wake Forest University include: Author Maya Angelou, Senators Richard Burr and Kay Hagan, Athletes Chris Paul, Tim Duncan and Arnold Palmer, and CEO Charlie Ergen.
Wake Forest has graduated many other successful alumni, including dozens of politicians, attorneys, physicians, scientists, and academics.
In May 2008, Wake Forest made college entrance exams optional for undergraduate admissions, becoming the first national university ranked in the top 30 by the U.S.
 News & World Report to adopt a test-optional policy. Being test-optional means Wake Forest's admissions process does not require applicants to submit their SAT or ACT scores,
 and students can decide if they want their standardized test scores to be considered.
Admission to Wake Forest is rated as "most selective" by U.S. News & World Report.
For fall 2014, Wake Forest received 11,119 freshmen applications; 3,826 were admitted (34.4%) and 1,287 enrolled.
The middle 50% range of SAT scores were 590-690 for critical reading, 620-730 for math, and 610-710 for writing.
 The middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 28-32.
The fall 2014 undergraduate student body is 47.5% male and 52.5% female, with the ethnic enrollment 74.5% white, 9.3% Asian, 6.6% African American, and 6.6% Hispanic.
 Forty-eight states and 35 countries are represented in the fall 2014 undergraduate student body, with 21.3% from North Carolina. Ninety-three percent of freshmen return for their sophomore year.
In addition to need-based financial aid programs, Wake Forest offers more than 50 merit-based scholarships, including the following full-tuition scholarships: Reynolds, Carswell, Stamps, and Gordon.
These scholarships are highly competitive and are awarded on the basis of academic distinction, leadership, community service, artistic talent, and a variety of other unique contributions and characteristics.</p>

    Amber Featherstone is no stranger to finding herself in a strange land. She spent two years living in Costa Rica recruiting teachers and traveling throughout South America, Europe and Asia.
    “Everything is so different, even things that we consider to be simple, everyday tasks can be done in completely unfamiliar ways,”
    she explains, adding that’s just one reason she can relate to the international students attending Wake Forest Law.
    “We don’t always think about how things that are common to us can seem so different to an international student or visitor."
And as the law school’s new director of International Programs and Assistant Director of Enrollment, Featherstone says her first priority is making sure the international students have everything they need to succeed.
“My main goal is to provide a high level of support to our international students and programs and to make sure our students are successful in their endeavors,” she says. “I want to make sure they are satisfied with their experience and feel the support of the Wake Forest Law family.”
Featherstone comes to Wake Forest Law from the Charlotte School of Law where she was the assistant director of Student Engagement for Diversity and International Student Support. There she managed the admissions and recruitment of LL.M. students as well as international student advising and relocation support and the school’s study abroad program.
“I served as the main contact for all international students on campus,” she says. “My favorite part of what I do is helping the students and getting to learn more about them and their cultures. I want them to know they can rely on me for support or help when needed.”
A native of Gastonia, North Carolina, Featherstone is a 2006 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There she earned a bachelor’s degree in International Studies. She also attended the Universite Paris Sorbonne in 2004. She worked in various roles with  VIF International Education before joining the Charlotte School of Law.
“I have always been passionate about the world and meeting people from other cultures,” she says. “I love what I do.”
Featherstone adds that she chose Wake Forest because of the people.  “Everyone is so kind, knowledgeable, warm and welcoming. And Wake Forest has such a strong school history. I am really excited to be a part of it.”
Professor Richard Schneider, associate dean for International Affairs, says Featherstone brings the perfect combination of knowledge about international students and programs, initiative and a welcoming manner.
“She steps into our programming at a pivotal time when a strong global presence means so much more to both our American and international students,” he says. “Amber’s excitement about international education is infectious. She will play a large role in the face Wake Forest Law presents to the world.”
