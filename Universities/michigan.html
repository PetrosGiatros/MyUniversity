The University of Michigan (U-M, UM, UMich, or U of M), frequently referred to simply as Michigan, is a public research university located in Ann Arbor,
 Michigan, United States. Originally, founded in 1817 in Detroit as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, 20 years before the Michigan
 Territory officially became a state, the University of Michigan is the state's oldest university. The university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres
 (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major
 buildings with a combined area of more than 34 million gross square feet (781 acres or 3.16 kmÂ²) spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus, has two
 satellite campuses located in Flint and Dearborn, and a Center in Detroit. The University was one of the founding members of the Association of American Universities.
