  <p>Michigan State University (MSU) is a public research university located in East Lansing, Michigan, United States.
MSU was founded in 1855 and became the nation's first land-grant institution under the Morrill Act of 1862, serving as a model for future land-grant universities.
The university was originally founded as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, one of the first institutions of higher education in the country to teach scientific agriculture.
Following the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU is the eighth-largest university in the United States
(in terms of enrollment) and has approximately 540,000 living alumni worldwide.
MSU is a member of the Association of American Universities, an organization of 62 leading research universities in North America.
The university's campus houses the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden, the Abrams Planetarium,
the Wharton Center for Performing Arts, the Broad Art Museum, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, and the largest residence hall system in the country.
MSU's Division I sports teams are called the Spartans, which compete in the Big Ten Conference. MSU's football team won the Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, 1988 and 2014 and six national championships.
Its men's basketball team won the NCAA National Championship in 1979 and 2000 and has enjoyed a streak of seven Final Four appearances since the 1998-1999 season. Its men's ice hockey won national titles in 1966,
1986 and 2007.
