  <p>Skidmore College is a private, independent liberal arts college in Saratoga Springs, New York. Approximately 2,500 students are enrolled at Skidmore pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in one of more than 60 areas of study.
Most of the buildings on Skidmore's 850-acre (3.4 km2) campus were constructed after 1960.
The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery is the college's main arts facility.
In addition to the Tang, Skidmore has undergraduate studio space as well as several smaller galleries.
The Saisselin Art Building houses studios for animation, ceramics, communication design, drawing, fibers,
metals, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture. Skidmore has a music program housed in the Arthur Zankel Music Center, which contains a large concert hall and facilities.
Most humanities classes are held in one of four academic buildings: Palamountain, Tisch, Bolton, and Ladd.
Harder Hall houses math and computer science; geology, chemistry, physics, and biology operate out of Dana Science Center.
Almost every classroom at Skidmore is equipped with a computer and a projector, and many contain other audiovisual equipment such DVD players and slide projectors.
The average class size is 17 (generally smaller in lab courses) and the typical student-to-teacher ratio is 8:1.
The Lucy Scribner Library houses approximately half a million volumes. Its five floors contain a large computer lab, approximately
sixty open computers on the main floor, with classrooms and private offices. A collection of rare books is kept in the third floor Pohndorff Room.
The third floor has a children's library which is used by Saratoga residents.
Skidmore maintains nine on-campus residence halls (Howe Hall, Jonsson Tower, Kimball Hall, McClellan Hall, Penfield Hall,
 Rounds Hall, Wait Hall, Wiecking Hall and Wilmarth Hall) and three on-campus apartment complexes (North Woods Village, Sussman Village, and the Hillside Houses).
Skidmore is known for its interdisciplinary approach to learning, faculty-student collaborative research, off-campus study
(60% of students study abroad), and the prominence of the performing and visual arts, enhanced by the unique Tang Teaching
Museum and Art Gallery and award-winning Arthur Zankel Music Center. The college's rigorous academic program begins with the foundational
First-Year Experience, which integrates the curricular, cocurricular, and residential aspects of a student's first year, and gets them connected
 and involved in the life of the community from day one. Students enjoy close relationships with talented faculty members who have earned recognition through Guggenheim,
 Pulitzer, and Emmy awards, and fellowships and grants from Fulbright, MacArthur, and the National Science Foundation, among others. At least half of students
 carry two majors or add a related minor to their major. More than half of Skidmore students pursue advanced degrees within five years of graduation.
