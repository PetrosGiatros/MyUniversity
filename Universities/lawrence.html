<template name="Law.description">
  <p>Lawrence University is a liberal arts college and conservatory of music in Appleton, Wisconsin.
    Founded in 1847, the school held its first classes on November 12, 1849. Lawrence was the second college
     in the United States to be founded as a coeducational institution. The school is a member of the Colleges
      That Change Lives and one of the Great Books Colleges.
In a study by the National Science Foundation, Lawrence ranked 28th nationally in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctorates.
The present campus, situated on 84 acres, contains 60 instructional, residential,
recreational and administrative facilities. Björklunden vid Sjön, Lawrence’s 425-acre northern campus,
 is located on Lake Michigan in Door County, Wisconsin. The student body of 1,500 students, drawn from
  nearly every state and more than 50 countries, is served by a full-time faculty of 165 men and women.
   Lawrence is accredited as a degree-granting institution by the North Central Association of Colleges
    and Secondary Schools, and the Conservatory of Music is an accredited institutional member of the National
     Association of Schools of Music. Lawrence also is a member of the Midwest Conference and National Collegiate Athletic Association, Division III (NCAA III).
Lawrence today is what it has been for much of its history, an undergraduate college of the liberal arts and sciences with a Conservatory of Music.
 It honors the vision of its founders and builds on the heritage of more than a century and a half of excellence in undergraduate education.
While holding fast to these enduring goals of liberal education, Lawrence continually has reassessed and reshaped its academic program
 in response to the changing contours of knowledge and changing views on the nature of learning. The tutorial system, first instituted
 by President Wriston, has blossomed into a wide range of options for independent learning. Freshman Studies, introduced by President
 Nathan Marsh Pusey (1944-53), today remains a distinctive expression of the commitment of the entire Lawrence community to the examination of ideas of abiding importance.
With the introduction of a number of overseas programs in the 1960s, Lawrence enhanced its ability to broaden the horizons of its students
through direct contact with other societies. The recent appearance in the curriculum of interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary offerings
 in biomedical ethics, cognitive science, East Asian Studies, Environmental Studies, Ethnic Studies, and Gender Studies, among others,
 reflects a concern that new knowledge be available to Lawrence students along with the traditional courses in the arts and sciences.
