# MyUniversity
MyUniversity is a project run by a team consisting of George Grivas, Dimitris Dimitrakopoulos and Petros Giatroutsikos. I, Rain, just helped out Petros by teaching him HTML / CSS / JS and helping him when he had difficulties. I also hosted the repo.

## Functionality
MyUniversity aims to help students who are trying to enter Universities in the US, by finding Universities they can enter based on the grades provided on registration. This way it should hopefully be easier for students to compare Universities and decide which one to enter.
